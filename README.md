# Chemprop for the discovery of Abaucin
Personal branch of chemprop used to predict the antibiotic Abaucin
The latest and up-to-date chemprop project can be found [here](https://github.com/chemprop/chemprop "Chemprop's Github"). In order to preserve reproducability of data, this fork contains the snapshot of chemprop used to predict for Abaucin in the paper Deep learning-guided discovery of a narrow-spectrum antibiotic against *Acinetobacter baumannii*[^1]. 

## Installation

>```git clone https://github.com/chemprop/chemprop.git
>cd chemprop
>conda env create -f environment.yml
>conda activate chemprop
>pip install -e .
>```

## Training
A model similar to that used to preduact Abaucin can be found **HERE** .

If you wish to train a new model on different data, continue on here, replacing paths where appropriate. 

If you wish to use the model to predict for antimicrobial activities on other data sets, move to the Prediction subheader. Training data for this data set is made available in the supplementary section of the paper[^1].
